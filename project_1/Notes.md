# xSim Project Notes

22 Oct 2016
===========
* Finished parsing all the types of instructions and have to begin
  working on specifics.
* There is no function for processing IX type instructions because
  the Imm11 and the opcode constitute the entire instruction

===========
* Found Bits module to simplify bitwise arithmetic
* Should create virtual environment for use with OCCAM
* The PC+2 value comes from each instruction being 16 bits. For
  simulation purposes this should be changed to PC+1.Completed []
